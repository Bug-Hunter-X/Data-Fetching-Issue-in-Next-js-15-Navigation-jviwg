# Next.js 15 Data Fetching Bug

This repository demonstrates a data fetching issue in Next.js 15.  The application consists of a homepage with a link to an 'About' page. The 'About' page fetches data from an API route.  The bug manifests when navigating to the 'About' page from the homepage, resulting in an unexpected rendering behavior (e.g. flickering, incorrect data display, or rendering errors) due to the timing of data fetching.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the homepage (`http://localhost:3000`).
5. Click the link to go to the 'About' page.
6. Observe the rendering behavior. You might see a brief loading state followed by the data, or you may encounter an error or unexpected display.

## Expected Behavior

The 'About' page should smoothly render after fetching data from the API route.  The initial render should show a loading indicator, and the component should update with the fetched data once available.

## Actual Behavior

The actual behavior varies depending on the timing and order of operations. Possible outcomes include: a flickering effect, the data being displayed after an unexpected delay, or errors in the rendering process.

## Solution

The solution involves careful handling of the data fetching process and the component's rendering lifecycle, often using techniques like loading states and optimizing the data fetching and updating strategy.
